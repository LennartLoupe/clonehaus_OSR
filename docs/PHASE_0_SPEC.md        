This file defines:
- Organization
    - Domains
    - Agents
    - Relationships
    - All authority metadata

No randomness.
No generators.
Deterministic only.

## Interaction Rules

    - Clicking a node highlights it
        - Parent - child relationships are visually reinforced
            - No drag - and - drop in Phase 0
                - No editing anywhere

Everything is ** read - only **.

---

## Visual Quality Bar

This phase should feel:
- Calm
    - Controlled
    - Enterprise - grade
    - Intentional

If a component feels “hacky,” it fails Phase 0.

## Exit Criteria(Phase 0 Is Done When)

All of the following are true:

-[] Org chart loads instantly
    - [] All node types render correctly
        - [] Structure View works
            - [] AI Footprint View works
                - [] Right - side panels exist for all node types
                    - [] Visual hierarchy is obvious without explanation
                        - [] No backend code exists
                            - [] No TODOs visible in UI

Only after this do we proceed to Phase 1.

## Phase 1 Preview(Not Implemented)

Phase 1 will introduce:
- Editable state
    - Local persistence
        - Authority inheritance logic
            - First Runtime hooks

Phase 0 must stand on its own before this begins.
