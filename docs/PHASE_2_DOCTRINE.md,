Phase 2 establishes Clonehaus as a deterministic authority system that is fully legible to humans without enabling execution.
At the end of this phase, every organization, domain, and agent has a clearly derived scope of authority; every restriction is explainable in calm, consequence-focused language; and every possible action is visible, classified, and reasoned about without ambiguity. Phase 2 explicitly refuses action, suggestion, or optimization. Its purpose is not to help users do things, but to help them understand exactly what is allowed, what is blocked, and why. Authority is inherited top-down, never escalated locally, and expressed consistently across structure, explanation, and action surfaces. With Phase 2 complete, Clonehaus transitions from a visual map (Phase 0) and contextual inspector (Phase 1) into a trustworthy authority lens. This lens becomes the non-negotiable foundation upon which controlled interaction may later be introduced, but it itself remains static, deterministic, and enforcement-agnostic.
