# Clonehaus OSR

Clonehaus OSR (Operating System Rebuild) is a clean, from-scratch rebuild of Clonehaus.

This version unifies:
- OS (authority + policy)
- Studio (agent persona configuration)
- Runtime (monitoring + enforcement)

All functionality is anchored in a single primary surface:
**the AI Org Chart**.

This repository starts frontend-first and will evolve into a full-stack system.
